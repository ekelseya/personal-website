## Synopsis

### Introduction

After identifying two shortcomings of modern cognitive computing:

1. Applications based on neural network and deep-learning frameworks do not focus on "human centered intrinsic information."
2. Human expectations of cognitive computing is increasing, while the availability of sustainably discoverable data is decreasing.

the authors propose a new human-centered cognitive cycle between machine, cyberspace, and the human.

### The Evolution of Cognitive Computing

They assert that behaviorism was eclipsed by cognitive science, defined as

> The interdisciplinary study of how information is formed and transcribed in the brain, mainly in computer science and cognitive neuroscience, also including cognitive psychology, linguistics, philosophy, etc.

*Note: figures are not accessible*
Big data and cognitive computing are contrasted; cognitive computing is focused on efficient processing with limited memory versus the [5Vs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/5-vs-of-big-data/) of big data.

### Cognitive Computing Architecture

Cognitive computing needs the support of underlying technologies: 5G networks, robotics and deep learning, and Internet of things (IoT) cloud infrastructures.

Data collected by IoT can be thought of as the data collected by human senses. Advances in the use of the IoT will improve cognitive computing, and advances in cognitive computing with improve the efficiency of the IoT.

Human brains are "big data" processors, much of it unstructured. Humans use cognition and judgement to reduce the fuzziness and uncertainty of perception. Advancements in cognitive computing have major implications in big data, and inversely, big data is necessary for cognitive computing.

> The machine can mine more hidden meaning from limited data using cognitive computing.

Cloud computing is a necessary part of the cognitive computing architecture to provide dynamic, flexible, and efficient resources.

### Enabling Technologies in Cognitive Computing

Traditional machine learning, whether supervised or unsupervised is not enough to advance cognitive computing. Reinforcement learning is the same way a child learns but can be very human work hour intensive. Crowd sourcing can eliminate the need for intensive, professional supervision. Consider the game [foldit](https://fold.it/) that crowd sourced research into protein folding. If this type of human supervision can be applied to cognitive computing a more accurate model of human thought processes can be developed.

Human thought can be divided into a perceptual method and a rational method of recognition. The authors talk about left- and right-brain thinking, although that is likely debunked. [See this study from the University of Utah.](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0071275) However, humans definitely use both rational and perceptual methods to recognize and interact with the world around them. Attempts to replicate these modes of thinking can been seen with image classification. Manual feature design simulates the rational method, whereas deep learning attempts to duplicate the perceptual method. 

### Application of Cognitive Computing

Robots: can be more human-like, with implications for social utilization. Emotional Communication System: smart systems that utilize cognitive computing may be able to recognize the user's emotional state and adjust accordingly. Medical Cognitive System: cognitive computing may be able to reduce health threats by quickly and accurately finding the correct data relation and death.

## Further Exploration

1. Advanced distributed information fusion technologies
2. Does prosopagnosia (face blindness) have any implications for image recognition?
