Sixth in Terry Pratchett's Disc World series, *Wyrd Sisters* is a brilliant and hilarious take on Shakespearean drama.

If Macbeth and Hamlet were thrown into a blender with a smattering of Douglas Adams and a hefty dose of Monty Python, you'd get *Wyrd Sisters*

## Synopsis

*Wyrd Sisters* is the second installment featuring Granny Weatherwax. We're introduced to her coven sisters: the lecherous Nanny Ogg and the flaky Magrat Garlick. Together they must save the kingdom of Lancre from the murderous, and quite insane, Duke Felmet.

Terry Pratchett was a dazzling virtuoso of humor and satire; the world became a tiny bit darker with his loss. Roz Kaveney in *Books* said it best:

> The trouble with books as funny as the Terry Pratchett Discworld series is that the best way to review them may be not to write a review but to stick a finger into the text at random, and transcribe what first comes to hand, in the confident expectation that it will reduce all readers to paroxysms of giggles. (It is unclear how proofreaders and typesetters manage ever to get books like this into print in the first place, except by working through the text backwards.)

## My thoughts

Although I've read this book many times, I'm currently listening to the audiobook narrated by Celia Imrie. Her voices are spot on, and the humor, both subtle and overt, shines through. My guffaws and cackles have startled more than one jogger on my walking path.
