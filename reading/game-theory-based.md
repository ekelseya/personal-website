## Synopsis

Dr. Shen-Guan Shih *et al.* created a theoretical model based on the Prisoner's Dilemma to analyze the inter- and intra-cooperation in student teams. They identified the critical number of uncooperative students that causes a cascade of competition, and made recommendations to improve cooperation between students in design studios.

This research has direct application in the computer science classroom. By assigning a high number of low value group tasks, the teacher can encourage cooperation between students, which can improve diversity retention.
