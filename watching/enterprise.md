At least once a year, I cycle through all of the second gen Star Treks (everything after the original series). I'm starting 2021 with the worst: Enterprise.

Yep, I said it. Enterprise is the worst of the Star Trek franchises. It's trope after trope after trope, but it has Jeffrey Combs, so...

## Synopsis

It's the year 2151. Humans have finally developed the first warp-five capable drive, no thanks to the Vulcans. Captain Archer, who blames the Vulcans for his father's death, keeping humanity from space, and not replacing the toilet paper roll, is saddled with a sexy Vulcan science officer on the Enterprise's maiden flight. 

The first two seasons aren't terrible (for a given amount of terrible). The Enterprise and her crew explore space and meet all sorts of new and exciting alien races like Klingons and Andorians, most of whom are played by Jeffrey Combs. There's a weird Temporal Cold War story arc that is never really resolved (who is Future Guy?), and T'Pol gets to wear a uniform, even if it is skin tight.

Apparently character driven stories weren't exciting enough, so in season three the Xindi are introduced, seven million humans are killed, and T'Pol has to wear velour. I never really understood why. 

In the final season we get a glimpse of the United Federation of Planets and Evil-Timeline Empress Hoshi.

## My thoughts

Yeah. I re-watch this every year or so, just because Roxann Dawson and LeVar Burton stepped in as directors (10 and 9 episodes respectively).
